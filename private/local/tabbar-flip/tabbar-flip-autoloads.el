Non-nil if Tabbar-Flip mode is enabled.
See the `tabbar-flip-mode' command
for a description of this minor mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')
or call the function `tabbar-flip-mode'.")

(autoload 'tabbar-flip-mode "tabbar-flip" "\
A global minor mode that streamlines the operation of
switching between tabs, with an emphasis on minimizing
keystrokes.  Inspired by the Alt-Tab convention in Windows.
Depends on `key-chord-mode'.

By default, the key chord to begin flipping through tabs is
\"u8\".  You can customize these keys with the variable
`tabbar-flip-keys'.

\"u\" and \"8\" are roughly analogous to Alt and Tab,
respectively.  To begin cycling through the tabs, press u and
8 at the same time or in rapid succession, `key-chord' style.
This begins the flipping process by switching to the next tabs.
At this point, pressing \"8\" by itself will continue to cycle
through the tabs.

Pressing * (shift-8 on an English keyboard) will
cycle in the opposite direction.  Just begin working in the
current tab to stop cycling.
